    <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Spitfire was formed in 2018 by four singers from the <a href="https://aoh.org/" target="_blank">Ambassadors of Harmony</a>. They won the <a href="https://singcsd.com/" target="_blank">Central States District</a> Quartet Contest in 2019, and due to unforeseen circumstances held that title for three years. They have had the wonderful fortune of competing in the last three <a href="https://www.barbershop.org/" target="_blank">Barbershop Harmony Society</a> International Competitions (2019, 2022, and 2023), and <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL12-zQU9P9IXBrNEnYp8kJFBWiPBmdedH&feature=shared" target="_blank">performing for audiences</a> across the country.
        </p>
        <p>The quartet is composed of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stephen Vandenberg (tenor)</li>
            <li>Chris Pingel (lead)</li>
            <li>Austin Veteto (baritone)</li>
            <li>JT Reid (bass)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They enjoy singing a variety of genres of music and display, as some have called it, <b>"real dad energy."</b></p>
