    <h2>FAQs</h2>

            <p><b>How does it work?</b></p>
                <p>
                    For every pint of beer sold, the brewery will donate $1 to the Harmony STL Foundation. So come thirsty, drink beer, and support a great cause!
                </p>
            <p><b>What to expect?</b></p>
                <p>
                    Expect a fun, casual evening of music, beer, and friends. Spitfire will sing a few songs, share some laughs, and enjoy the company of our barbershop family. We will have shirts for sale if you want to take home a souvenir!
                </p>
            <p><b>Why do you do this?</b></p>
                <p>
                    Spitfire loves barbershop and we are passionate about supporting the next generation of barbershop singers. We believe that music is a vital part of life and we want to help provide opportunities for young people to learn and grow through music. Also, we love beer, supporting local breweries, hanging out with our barbershop family, singing tags, and creating informal opportunities to introduce friends to barbershop.
                </p>
            <p><b>What is the Harmony STL Foundation?</b></p>
                <p>
                    The Harmony STL Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides financial support to youth in harmony programs in the St. Louis area. The Foundation helps fund scholarships, music education programs, and other opportunities for young people to learn and grow through music.
